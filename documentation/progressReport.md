# Current Overall Project Analysis 

#### What went to plan
The software is going very well to plan. The code skeleton is supporting an abstract, streamlined development which has lead to the quadrant 1 and 2 code working, and can be easily tested with our testing classes. The project plan has been of help, having an anchor to rely on and look to see what we have to do


#### What did not go plan
The prototype was harder to make than expected. The first prototype, made from popsicle sticks failed to allow us to test Q2 on the first week and delayed testing until Tuesday week two. The hardware is also running slightly behind schedule, as we had planned to have a lot of components printed by the week two, but some stuff is still being finalised.


#### What is the bottleneck / slowing development?
Initially, the lack of a solid prototype to test our software on. However, now that we do have a prototype to do so on, we can continue writing code for Q3 too. This bottleneck has subsided for now. But, this prototype does not support a rotation of the camera, so we cannot write code for Q4 on it. The hardware also needs to be completed as soon as possible, as the code needs to be configured for the specific mass and weight distribution of the car. In addition to this, the prototype is not viable for final submission as it utilises hot glue and will be heaviliy penalised. In short, the hardware is the current bottleneck.


#### Team recommendations for advancing progress
<ul>
  <li>Dedicate more time towards hardware and make this core priority!!</li>
  <li>Improve Q2 and continue writing code for Q3</li>
  <li>Continue keeping up a clean codebase (refactor code) and comment!!</li>
</ul>
Otherwise, good job team keep it up! We got this.
